# community-science-museum_v2
This was the semester project 1 in my first year as a Frontend web development student at Noroff. It is a responsive website for a fictional science museum. The site mainly relies on HTML and CSS, but some Javascript is added to import news and manipulate DOM.

## Project focus
The assignment was focused on HTML/CSS skills, project planning, target audience analysis, SEO, conformity to WCAG guidelines, and visual design.
